\section{Introduction}
Submodularity is a property of set functions with deep theoretical and practical consequences. Submodular functions occur in a variety of applications, including representative skyline selection \cite{SLN+11}, network structure learning \cite{GLK10}, influence maximization \cite{KKT03}, document summarization \cite{LB11}, image segmentation \cite{BJM01,KKT09} and many others.


There is a large body of research in submodular optimization which we can not cover thoroughly here. In this survey, we focus on the recent advances in optimizing (mostly, maximizing) submodular functions in distributed and streaming setting.


\subsection{Notations}
Through out this survey, 

we use $V$ to represent the ground set we consider. 

$2^V$ is the power set of $V$ (i.e. the set of all subsets of $V$).

For simplicity, we sometime write $A \cup \{x\}$ as $A + x$.
